# SGX-CMake

CMake file for compiling with Intel SGX.

To make compiling code using SGX with CMake easier, a single FindSGX.cmake file is provided for the purpose.

This code example is from official Intel SGX sample [Cxx11SGXDemo](https://github.com/01org/linux-sgx/tree/master/SampleCode/Cxx11SGXDemo).

Please refer to the CMakeLists.txt file for how to use FindSGX.cmake file.

## How to use

```
list(APPEND CMAKE_MODULE_PATH ${PATH_TO_FindSGX.cmake_FILE})
find_package(SGX REQUIRED)
```

The following variables are provided:
- SGX_HW # ON for hardware, OFF for simulation.
- SGX_MODE # Debug; PreRelease; Release.
- SGX_INCLUDE_DIR
- SGX_TLIBC_INCLUDE_DIR
- SGX_LIBCXX_INCLUDE_DIR
- SGX_INCLUDE_DIRS # all 3 dirs above
- SGX_LIBRARY_DIR

The following functions are provided:
```

                    [USE_PREFIX]
                    [USE_SGXSSL]

```

## ROS

A ROS package sgx_cmake is provided for using inside ROS.

To use it, clone the repo to catkin_ws/src, and in the projects which need to use it:
```
# add in package.xml
<build_depend>sgx_cmake</build_depend>

# add in CMakeLists.txt
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS sgx_cmake)
find_package(SGX)
```
